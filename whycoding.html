      <h1> I’m interested in tech </h1>
      </br>
      <h2> One of the main reasons I want to learn coding is that I’m interested in tech. In April 2017, I got the chance to do a three month internship at a think tank based in Rio called the Institute for Technology and Society. I met some amazing people who were both passionate about ensuring that technology was regulated so as to avoid any negative impacts on society, as well as leveraging the potential of technology as a tool for democracy. One project they were working on whilst I was there was Mudamos, an app which used blockchain technology so that people could sign petitions online for bills to be considered by congress. I loved figuring out how blockchain technology worked and looking into its wide range of use cases, so when I started university I joined the Blockchain Society and then London Blockchain Labs as an events executive. I also took modules related to technology such as Science Policy, Governance of Emerging Technologies, Science Peace and Warfare and Tech Journalism.

      <h1> I like learning languages </h1>
      </br>
      <h2> The bottom line is, I love learning languages. I was lucky enough to grow up bilingual (English and French) and then learnt Spanish at school. When I spent three months in Brazil during my GAP year I also taught myself Portuguese. Right now I’m trying to learn Arabic, although it’s definitely a bigger challenge !
        A lot of what I enjoy about learning languages also applies to programming. First of all, it’s the kind of knowledge that’s hard to forget. Once you’ve learnt a new word, it’s hard to forget it. Whenever you see it again, the meaning will come back to you, and you can also use the context to deduce its meaning. The more languages you know, the more you can guess the meaning of words. Although there are different languages in programming, knowing one can often help you understand another.
        There is no single answer - one thing which is encouraging about learning a language is that once you know the basics, you can always get the meaning across, no matter how clumsy the approach might be. This means that you can learn through practice - you might start out making very weird sentences, but as you speak to more and more people you start incorporating new vocabulary and understanding the best way of saying things.
        With coding, it’s the same. As I’ve been doing some of the codewars for my application, I’ve noticed that I can solve many of the problems with the small amount of programming I know. Whilst I am aware that sometimes the code I am writing is not the most efficient way of doing things, it’s encouraging to still be able to do things and then compare what I’ve written with other people’s solutions so that I can learn from them and use these in the future.

      <h1> I want to be able to make stuff </h1>
      </br>
      <h2> I never used to think of myself as a creative individual because I wasn’t very good at art. However, I’ve come to realise over the years that I like coming up with new ideas. I have a running list in my phone for apps or gadgets that are mostly useless but fun to think about. I would like to be able to build small projects like these in my free time.
        During my time at London Blockchain Labs, I also realised that I wanted to be part of product development. Although I enjoyed being an events executive and getting involved in many other parts of the organisation such as business development and recruitment, the one part I yearned to be in was the LABS team. They were the ones that decided what projects to work on and then made them a reality.
