      <h1> Tech for social good </h1>
      <h2> One of the main aspects that drew me to Founders and Coders is your focus on tech for social good. I first heard about Founders and Coders through the 80,000 hours blog, an organisation that stems from the effective altruism movement.
        I have been interested in working for NGOs and in the development space for a while, but

      <h1> Inclusivity and accessibility </h1>
      <h2> I strongly appreciate the effort that FAC has put into making the program free. I believe that the current price of other bootcamps adds a financial barrier to entry, which negatively impacts access to such opportunities and thus contributes to inequality. In addition to this, the fact that you ensure at least half of the cohort ensures that you are inclusive and work towards increasing diversity in tech.
      </h2>
      </br>

      <h1> Teaching style </h1>
      <h2> I was also drawn to the FAC teaching style. I like the fact that a lot of the learning is done through pair programming. Actively engaging with the material through peer programming and by getting everyone to figure out the solution together is a much better way of learning than being spoon-fed knowledge.
        The fact that the second part of the program is based on learning through projects for non-profit organisations is a great way of increasing motivation as well as producing useful outcomes from the learning process.
      </h2>
      </br>

      <h1> Community </h1>
      <h2> I actually really enjoyed the application process. I believe it’s a great way of ensuring that the FAC cohorts are made up of individuals who have a strong motivation to study programming and are sure that they actually enjoy it.
        The fact that FAC has such a clear set of values and is based on the idea of giving back through help with the next cohorts means that it builds a strong community.
        I have only heard good things about Founders and Coders from individuals of previous cohorts, and the fact that graduates sometimes come back to redesign or add to the curriculum even years after they’d left speaks mountains for the strength of the FAC community.
