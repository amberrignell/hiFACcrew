      <h1> Tech for social good </h1>
      <h2> One of the main aspects that drew me to Founders and Coders is your focus on tech for social good. I first heard about Founders and Coders through the 80,000 hours blog, an organisation that stems from the effective altruism movement. I am interested in the ways in which technology can be leveraged to create, improve and scale social impact initiatives.
        </br> I am very interested in the nonprofit world, and am currently running the London Chapter for a non-profit called Opportutoring. We provide free English tutoring to refugees in order to help them access better job opportunities or university. We will actually be taking on some students from Gaza Sky Geeks, which I found out about whilst browsing through your ‘tech for social good’ section.
          I was also able to attend Accelerate Good Global, an event focussed on tech for social good and which was moved online due to the coronavirus lockdowns.
        </br> I would like to put my programming skills towards having a social impact, be it through working at a non-profit or volunteering in my spare time.

      <h1> Teaching style </h1>
      <h2> I was also drawn to the FAC teaching style. As someone who enjoys learning through discussions with my peers, I believe that your model focussed on pair programming is well suited to me. Actively engaging with the material through peer programming and by getting everyone to figure out the solution together is a much better way of learning than being spoon-fed knowledge. To come back to your focus on social impact, I also love the fact that we will be working on projects for non-profit organisations in the second stage of the program. I believe this is a great way of increasing motivation, encouraging students to do their maximum as well as producing useful outcomes from the learning process
      </h2>
      </br>

      <h1> Inclusivity and accessibility </h1>
      <h2> I strongly appreciate the effort that FAC has put into making the program free. I believe that the current price of other bootcamps adds a financial barrier to entry, which negatively impacts access to such opportunities and thus contributes to inequality. In addition to this, the fact that you ensure at least half of the cohort ensures that you are inclusive and work towards increasing diversity in tech.
      </h2>
      </br>



      <h1> Community </h1>
      <h2> I actually really enjoyed the application process. I believe it’s a great way of ensuring that the FAC cohorts are made up of individuals who have a strong motivation to study programming and are sure that they actually enjoy it.
      The fact that FAC has such a clear set of values and is based on the idea of giving back through help with the next cohorts means that it builds a strong sense of community amongst students.
      I have only heard good things about Founders and Coders from individuals of previous cohorts, and the fact that graduates sometimes come back to redesign or add to the curriculum even years after they’ve left speaks mountains for the strength of the FAC community.
